It just happened, that I was doing something completely else and didn't pay attention when entering my YubiKey PIN incorrectly 3 times... 

In the end I was stuck with a not working YubiKey gpg agent. That's when I started searching on how to easily unlock it with the admin key (called PUK) and couldn't find any easy guides.
