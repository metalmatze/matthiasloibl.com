title: About

---
Hey, I am Matthias Loibl, a Software Engineer from Berlin.

Currently I work for a company called [Polar Signals](https://www.polarsignals.com/).  
Next to building the hosted continuous profiling service, we work on an open source continuous profiling project written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) called [Parca](https://www.parca.dev/)!

Overall I enjoy working on Distributed Systems and Web Applications with Go and sometimes with [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). I deploy my applications with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and monitor them with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).  
These days I learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) when time allows and in the past I have created projects with all kinds of software, such as [Android](https://www.android.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).
