Hey, I am Matthias Loibl, a Software Engineer from Berlin.

I enjoy working on Distributed Systems and Web Applications with [Go](https://golang.org) and sometimes with [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).
I deploy my applications with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and monitor them with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
In the past I have created projects with all kinds of software, such as [Android](https://www.android.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/). I work at Red Hat with the OpenShift monitoring team.
